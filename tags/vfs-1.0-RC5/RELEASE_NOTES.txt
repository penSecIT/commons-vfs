2005-10-14 commons-vfs 1.0 RC5

zip, jar, tar:
close archive if there is no open stream. This avoids locking on the archive.

sftp:
stip off link file names, though still no link-support for sftp.
added filesystem option: setUserDirIsRoot


2005-09-26  commons-vfs 1.0 RC4

bzip:
changed documentation to use latest commons-compress.


filesystems:
fix: avoid creation of filesystem if they use the same options


threading:
avoid gc when referencing only inputStream/outputStream of a fileObject


filenames:
add a type (file/folder) to filename.
This is needed to allow URI style filename resolving
e.g. base "file:///path/to/file" with relative name "any/file" results in "file:///path/to/any/file" instead
of "file:///path/to/file/any/file"
This is experimental code. Switch on with "VFS.setUriStyle(true);" before ANY other VFS operation.


ant tasks:
added antlib.xml - (Jacob Kjome)


zip, jar, ....:
allow filenames without trailing "!"
allow createFilesystem with .gz files
better handling of file/folder flag with compressed files


ftp:
check IOException instead of FTPConnectionClosedException.
This should make ftp retry more robust even if for some case the state of the
socket isnt correctly reported as closed.

ignore nonparseable ftp directory entries. It will be logged using the debug log-level
with class org.apache.commons.vfs.provider.ftp.FtpFileObject.
(e.g. empty lines in ftp directory listing)

avoid server-roundtrip ("LIST") if file was deleted. if you add a child this is still needed.

allow configuration of dataTimeout

fix for special characters in username/password
allow domains with DOMAIN\USERNAME syntax
